# Flask_Projects
This is my first Flask project. I am learning Flask and decided to create this project to put into practice what I have learned so far.

Installation
To run this project, you must have Python and Flask installed. If you don't have Python, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install Flask, you can use pip, the Python package manager:
pip install flask
Execution
To run this project, you must first clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/username/my-flask-project.git
Next, you must navigate to the project folder:


cd my-flask-project
Finally, you can start the development server with the following command:

Copy code
python app.py
This will start the server at http://localhost:5000.

Contributions
If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork it and submit your changes in a pull request. Be sure to follow Flask best practices and write tests for your code.
